            <div class="tm_pb_toggle_content clearfix">

              <p>The Consumer Directed Personal Assistance Program (CDPAP) is a statewide Medicaid program that provides
                an alternative way of receiving home care services, in which the consumer has more control over who
                provides his or her care and how it is provided. This program enables consumers or their guardians to be
                self-directing and to assume the responsibility for their own care, giving the consumers more
                independence and allowing them to feel more autonomous.

              <p>There are three points that must be noted to be eligible to apply for participation in the CDPAP
                program.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Must be a member of Medicaid.</li>
                <li>Must actually need home care.</li>
                <li>Recipients, their legal guardians or other persons designated to help and guide them must be able
                  and willing to make informed decisions regarding the management of the services they receive.
                </li>
                <li>The consumer or designee must also be responsible for recruiting, hiring, training,
                  supervising-including payroll record keeping and terminating the caregiver’s service. In the event
                  that back-up coverage is needed, an alternative plan of care should be implemented by the consumer or
                  designee.
                </li>
              </ul>
